# Covid-19 Communication Via TikTok, Instagram and Twitter from Essential Workers and Healthcare Organizations
## by Halle Brennan
### May, 2021

### Introduction

The coronavirus has changed the way that communities, families, brands and influencers alike communicate and connect with each other. Essential businesses, pharmaceutical companies, news organizations and more have also been forced to adapt to the drastically changing environment and communicate with humankind in a way otherwise unknown to mankind. In times of isolation and online interaction, essential businesses, pharmaceutical companies and news organizations have shown increased reliance on social media to communicate with larger communities, specifically more innovative, creative platforms such as Instagram, Twitter and TikTok. The Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated social media use among U.S. consumers and has also transformed the dynamics of the electronic marketplace by creating social networks of consumers, opinion leaders and field experts (Mason et. al, 2021).

It is understandable that noneducational screen time among young people greatly escalated during the pandemic, allowing individuals to stay connected with the outside world as more formerly conventional means of communication have become increasingly practical. He and Harris (2020) noted that the Covid-19 pandemic has accelerated social media use among U.S. consumers and has also transformed the dynamics of the electronic marketplace by creating social networks of consumers, opinion leaders and field experts. With different geographical locations undergoing various stay-at-home orders, limited indoor capacities and a multitude of lifestyle and environmental changes, consumers are in need of new ways to engage themselves and remain in tune with new developments pertaining to the pandemic. This social media analysis dives deeper into exploring how Instagram, Twitter and TikTok have paved the way for essential communication during the Covid-19 era, as well as how specific accounts and organizations are utilizing the indicated social media platforms.

### TikTok and Its Burgeoning Pandemic Popularity

TikTok is one of the fastest-growing social platforms in the world. TikTok originally allowed users to create, promote and react to short-form music video content, but now the social media platform offers so much more. Isolation created a need for people to entertain themselves and connect with others (Johnson, 2020). The social media platform has a strong identity - TikTok knows its purpose of helping users share and create unique video content that resonates with others. TikTok is designed to inspire and entertain with authentic, creative content that is unique to the platform itself. Rather than pushing those who have already gained large amounts of followers, users are getting recommendations from real and authentic people and organizations regardless of following, which sets TikTok aside from any other social media platform.

The platform has an engaged community with an already developed following before the coronavirus hit, which paved the way for newcomers - including those within the healthcare space - to join. In the second quarter of 2020, TikTok was the number one top grossing application on iOS App Store globally, benefiting from consumers turning to mobile apps during the Covid-19 pandemic (Kale, 2020). With a social network of more than 45.6 million active users in the United States (with 63 percent of users under the age of 29 years), TikTok has been one of the most recent platforms to surge in promise during the pandemic (Ostrovsky & Chen, 2020). 

A recent study by Ostrovsky and Chen (2020) analyzed the 100 most popular videos in each of the three largest Covid-19-related categories on TikTok. The categories consisted of videos marked with the hashtags #covid-19, #covid19 and #coronavirus. On average, 63.3 percent of the videos were filmed by healthcare professionals, followed by 15.66 percent of videos communicating pragmatic health information, and 2.66 percent of the videos being filmed by young adult patients tracking their recovery journeys (Ostrovsky & Chen, 2020). This distribution suggests that the overall demand on TikTok for more healthcare-related voices currently outpaces the supply. TikTok has proven itself to be a viable means for practitioners to educate and dispel myths about Covid-19 to a broad and diverse adolescent demographic. In return, practitioners gained the ability to share their voices with those that they likely would not have reached otherwise while potentially expanding public policy adherence and reducing hospitalizations (Johnson, 2020).

### Meet @drleslie: One of the “Most Impactful Creators” on TikTok in 2020

Many frontline workers have flocked to TikTok to combat false claims with their expertise, transparency, reliability and credibility. An example of this concept is Dr. Rose Marie Leslie, a chief family medicine resident at the University of Minnesota Medical School (Law, 2021). With a total of 907.9K followers and 24.7M likes on TikTok, Dr. Leslie is someone who TikTok users rely on and enjoy following. 

Dr. Leslie frequently posts TikTok videos about health issues from her home and the hospital. Named one of the “most impactful creators'' of 2020, Dr. Leslie believed it to be important to reach young people because many of them were at a time in their lives when they were hungry for health information, but they did not know where to look for it and were not going to the doctor frequently. She aimed to show young people that the decisions they make about Covid-19 can make a huge difference for their communities (Law, 2021). One of Dr. Leslie’s most popular TikToks is a video of her getting the vaccine and sharing her experience with side effects. 

Dr. Leslie’s goals with some of her TikTok videos are to tell her story and the experience she has from working at the hospital, seeing patients during the pandemic and the toll that it takes on herself and every other healthcare worker out there. In doing so, she aimed to inspire people to practice social distancing, mask wearing and guideline following. She also attempted to reduce the spread of medical misinformation by teaching followers how to judge sources and question what they see online.

Dr. Leslie stated, “There is so much (misinformation) online right now...a lot of it is really detailed and makes people really question a lot of other information they hear. Twenty-five percent of my followers don’t live in the United States. That is really just such a cool thing about social media that you can learn from people that live across the globe and help come up with strategies to help improve your own community” (Law, 2021).

Dr. Leslie is exemplary proof of how essential workers have become successful influencers in the social media space on TikTok. She brings an authentic, playful approach to posting educational content on TikTok that is transparent, reliable and entertaining. For younger audiences and demographics who do not rely on linear news media on television, TikTok is an innovative platform that provides updates and essential information regarding pertinent Covid-19 topics in a quick and easy way to comprehend (Law, 2021).

### Instagram’s Aid in Covid-19 Communication

Instagram is a social media network like no other. Instead of words, the platform is built almost entirely around sharing images and videos exclusively. With over a billion registered accounts, Instagram has become a part of daily life (Antonelli, 2020). According to eMarketer, time spent on Instagram was estimated to grow by 14 percent this year, which equates to three minutes of additional time spent by each user each day (Antonelli, 2020). It is clear that Instagram was on the rise as a result of stay-at-home orders brought on by the coronavirus pandemic.

Instagram is no stranger to communicating and maintaining transparency in times of crisis, obstacles and challenges. Instagram became an outlet for brands, businesses, organizations, individuals and influencers alike to post content related to raising awareness, producing educational content and sharing diverse perspectives on a variety of topics, issues and movements (Dabbagh, 2020). Throughout the escalation of the coronavirus pandemic specifically, Instagram kept its audience consistently updated in its efforts to aid in the pandemic. The social media platform released information, stating that the platform had teams working to connect people around the world with authoritative Covid-19 information and to help support the businesses and communities most impacted by the pandemic. Doctors relied on Instagram to keep people informed on the latest precautions. Furthermore, Instagram globally introduced the Covid-19 information center to help connect people to more information about the pandemic from health authorities in regards to who is eligible for the vaccine, information about prevention from trusted health organizations, and content disproving common vaccine myths (Instagram, 2021).

### @who: A Trusted Resource on Instagram

The World Health Organization is the United Nations’ health agency committed to achieving better health for everyone. With 10.6 million followers on Instagram, the World Health Organization (WHO) is listed as a trusted resource on Instagram for coronavirus information. This means that Instagram has listed the organization as a reliable, credible account for users to refer to for any information, educational resources and Covid-19 prevention updates and tips. The WHO utilizes and embraces every type of visual opportunity on Instagram to be an effective and proactive voice to the world. Throughout the duration of the Covid-19 pandemic, the WHO has created and shared consistent, up-to-date content that is user friendly and easy for users to understand. 

The WHO employs graphic design initiatives to produce informational content and tips. Below is an example of content from a single Instagram post regarding what to do if someone is sick in a specific household. The caption read, “These are some steps you should take if someone in your household falls sick from #COVID19. These will help keep yourself, the rest of your household and the sick person as safe as possible. 👉  Swipe to learn more.” The post visuals are as follows:

The WHO also successfully uses Instagram stories and highlights pertaining to the medical reasons why the vaccines work (#VaccinesWork highlight), how the organization is working to share Covid-19 information (#COVID19 highlight), an interactive quiz highlight that tests users how well they know the coronavirus (#COVID19Quiz highlight), user-generated content that the account shares on its highlight called #WearAMask and more. The World Health Organization has adapted to the changing environment brought about by Covid-19 as well as the youthful, creative Instagram landscape. The WHO posts content based on scientific findings, evidence and research, and has proven to be an example of how health organizations have infiltrated the social media space during Covid-19.

### Effective Crisis Communication on Twitter

Twitter is a platform that plays a significant role in crisis communication and can be a powerful tool for communicators to connect with customers, employees and the broader ecosystems during unprecedented times. Since the emergence and subsequent outbreak of Covid-19, there have been millions of tweets and retweets about the virus and the globe (Josephson & Lambe, 2020). In a recent study by Josephson and Lambe (2020), Covid-19-related tweets were being posted every 45 milliseconds, with #coronavirus being the second most used hashtag of 2020. This reflects a large appetite for seeing and sharing news and information related to the virus as it unfolds.

Unlike other platforms, Twitter did not look to the pandemic outbreak as a “marketing opportunity” to capitalize on. Twitter sought to recognize that this is the new reality and requires thoughtful navigation from everyone (Khabbaz, 2020). Not only did Twitter keep blog posts updated on a rolling basis and encourage users to consult with them for updates regarding contingency strategy to protect the conversation, working guidance to employees and partners to keep them safe, and partnerships and public engagement strategies, but Twitter took specific steps to foster an effective and beneficial system for relevant Covid-19 information, tips and updates. Twitter sought to build systems that enabled the team to continue to enforce rules remotely around the world, instituted a global content severity triage system, executed daily assurance checks, engaged with partners around the world, continued to review the Twitter Rules in context of Covid-19, and more (Hutchinson, 2020).

Twitter aimed to advise brands on what is important, and provided five key tips to organizations who are active on the platform (Twitter, 2020):

1. Know the brand being represented. This is all about understanding the unique role that a brand plays in people’s lives, how that has changed, and how brands can help or be useful during the crisis. This is also relevant in looking for opportunities to lead by example and do the right thing, where it makes sense for businesses.
2. Stay up-to-date with what is happening. Consider the context before replying or broadcasting. Twitter specifically created a prompt which directs people searching for coronavirus content to accurate information from the relevant local bodies. The prompt runs in 64 countries and is in 20 languages. Twitter furthermore pushed only the most important content on top of search results and in user home timelines.
3. Be thoughtful about the tone of voice. Brands should evolve their tone depending on content. Empathy, understanding and even certain types of humor have proven to go a long way. Listen to what people, and customers, are saying - and reflect that in copy and tone appropriately.
4. Anticipate changes in customer’s behavior. As people are asked to self-isolate or stay home, there will be a number of behavior changes that impact their needs as well as how they interact with their businesses. Anticipated consumer behavior changes include, but are not limited to, an increased shift to e-commerce and online shopping and a significant boom in live-streaming content for entertainment and essential news.

Twitter understood what people needed - and continue to need - during the pandemic: accurate and reliable information, customer service and support, distraction and levity, and community and positivity. In times of crisis during the Covid-19 pandemic, the Twitter platform enabled essential businesses, pharmaceutical companies, news organizations to successfully inform, connect, entertain and help communities who needed it most (Hutchinson, 2020).

### The @CDCgov Providing Credible Health Information on Twitter

The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has a branded Twitter page for daily credible health and safety updates. With 3.8 million followers, the CDC posts national and international content for Twitter users of different geographical locations to view and interact with. 

![cdc1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78876756/117591055-89814980-b100-11eb-9a1a-4d3111c65390.jpg)
![cdc2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78876756/117591058-8b4b0d00-b100-11eb-9700-4dcc76ebfe9a.jpg)

The content above is from a May 5, 2021 Twitter post from the CDC explaining that Covid-19 is still incredibly relevant, despite the decrease in overall rates. The CDC is strategically communicating to its audience on Twitter to continue to take the vaccine seriously, only using 280 characters. The CDC appeals to those who have been vaccinated and to those who have not by encouraging them to continue to practice healthy habits. The CDC included a link to its website that displays the United States at a glance in terms of Covid-19 cases:

The CDC presented a strong presence on Twitter with informational content to help keep the world safe. The CDC connects directly with its audience on Twitter with its helpful tips, case updates, initiatives that people can do to be proactive in the process in reducing the spread of the coronavirus.

### The Covid-19 and Social Media Connection: Wrap-Up

The coronavirus pandemic has produced a global health crisis that has had a deep impact on the way society perceives the world and everyday livelihood. With the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic, social media has rapidly become a crucial communication tool for information generation, dissemination, consumption and more. The Covid-19 pandemic has resulted in an avalanche of information, some of it false and misleading. Social media posts with misleading or dangerous opinions and analyses were often amplified by celebrities and social media influencers. These posts have contributed to the mass of information available. An emerging force in this information is the essential frontline workers and healthcare organizations entering the innovative, younger social media spaces like TikTok, Instagram and Twitter to bring real-world experience and scientific reasoning and evidence to the Covid-19 discussion. On these social media platforms, organizations have learned how to connect with audiences in different ways, maintain credibility and uphold transparency during an unprecedented environmental change.
